# SeReMpy
Seismic Reservoir Modeling Python package

The SeReM package includes four libraries and a data folder:

Data: this folder contains six datasets used for the examples and the elevation dataset from Yellowstone National Park;
RockPhysics: this library contains functions with several rock physics models;
Geostats: this library contains functions for kriging and geostatistical simulations of random variables;
Inversion: this library contains functions for seismic and rock physics inversion using the analytical and numerical solutions; the functions are subdivided into three subfolders: Seismic, Petrophysical, and EnsembleSmoother;
Facies: this library contains functions for facies classification and simulation. The SeReM package includes multiple scripts with several examples.

For a detailed description, we refer to Grana, D., Mukerji, T., and Doyen, P., 2021, Seismic reservoir modeling: Wiley.
